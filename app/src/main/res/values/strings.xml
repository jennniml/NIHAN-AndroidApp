    <string name="denturecare_step1">
        Brush your dentures every day using a soft bristle denture brush to remove food and plaque. Do the same to your tongue and gums.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step2">
        Handle your dentures with care. They are very delicate and can break if you drop it. Hold them with a soft towel when handling over water.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step3">
        Be careful when eating hot or hard food and sharp edge bones. They may damage your dentures.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step4">
        When not wearing your dentures, soak them in water or dental solution recommended by your dentist. Dentures will lose their shape if they dry out. NEVER PLACE THEM IN HOT WATER.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step5">
        Avoid cleaning your dentures with household cleaners that are abrasive.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step6">
        Remove your dentures before you go to bed. This allows gum tissues to rest and promote oral health.
    </string>
    <string name="denturecare_step7">
        Avoid making minor adjustments to your denture. Always see your dentist if your denture breaks, crack, chip, and if one or more teeth become loose.
